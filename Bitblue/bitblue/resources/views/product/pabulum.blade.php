                                framework consists of various
                                components that come together to

                            <h4>Why Pabulum ?</h4>
                            <p>Menu management at restaurants is typically a
                                very expensive process – not simply in terms of
                                direct costs but also through intangible indirect
                                costs like – varying commodity prices, ability to
                                react to consumer feedback, stock outs and
                                other similar issues. All of these translate into a
                                need for restaurants having a platform where the
                                consumer facing menu needs to be updated
                                dynamically. The PABULUM Android/iPad digital
                                menu platform seeks to enhance the diner
                                experience, empower them to get a more
                                personalized service while giving a powerful
                                revenue management tool in the hands of the
                                restaurant management. All this, without having
                                to depend on infrastructure – internet
                                connectivity. The PABULUM end-to-end platform
                                has a hybrid architecture which ensures that the
                                restaurant continues to function without any
                                dependence on connectivity and allows
                                restaurant management to dynamically make
                                changes to menu items, prices, availability
                                information, images, videos, or any other related
                                updates.</p>
